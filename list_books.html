If you want a comprehensive journey into one of the most important JavaScript frameworks around today, dive into this course. What You Will Learn Take control of the front end with reactive JavaScript programming Discover what ReactJS offers your development - before mastering it Create React elements with properties and children Use JSX to speed up your React development process Test your React components with the Jest test framework Learn the latest syntax of ES6 Execute ES6 in a non-supported ES6 environment Learn the principles of object-oriented programming Create a complete single-page application Use an application design plan to write smarter, more meaningful code Learn how to use animations to give extra style to your application Get to grips with the React Native environment Write your own custom native UI components Integrate native modules in Objective-C and Java that interact with JavaScript In Detail ReactJS has helped to transform the web as we know it. Designed by Facebook to help developers build rapid, responsive UI that can deal with data-intensive usage, it's an essential component in any web developer's skillset. This ReactJS course, in five connected modules, provides you with a fast, engaging and practical route into ReactJS—so you can build powerful, elegant, and modern web applications. Beginning with the Reactive Programming with JavaScript module, you will learn how to take advantage of a reactive and functional programming paradigm to rethink how you approach your JavaScript code. It's built to help you understand the concepts, relevant and applicable for any frontend developer. You'll then dive a little deeper into ReactJS. The second module gives you a rapid look through the fundamentals of ReactJS, showing you how to build a basic application and demonstrating how to implement the Flux architecture. In the third module you will get to grips with ES6—this will make you a more fluent JavaScript developer, giving you control over ReactJS. You can put your old JavaScript hacks aside and instead explore how to create ES6 custom iterators. In the final two modules you'll learn how to fully master ReactJS, exploring its wider ecosystem of tools that have helped to make it one of the most important tools in web development today. Ending with insights and guidance on React Native, the tool built for today's demand for native, intuitive user experiences and interfaces, with this course you can be confident in building dynamic and modern apps with React. Style and approach Consisting of five separate modules, journey from the fundamentals of reactive programming to the exciting possibilities of React Native. Each module builds on each other, helping you to incrementally develop your skills and knowledge.",

This book is a comprehensive, project-based introduction to TestCafe that will show you how to use the TestCafe framework and enable you to write fast and reliable tests; plus you’ll have a proof of concept ready to demonstrate the practical potential of TestCafe. You’ll begin by learning how to write end-to-end web tests using the TestCafe syntax and features of the TestCafe framework. You’ll then go from setting up the environment all the way through to writing production-ready tests. You’ll also find out how to build a sample set of tests in a step-by-step manner and use TestCafe to log in to the website, verify the elements present on different pages, create/delete entities, and run custom JavaScript code. As you advance, you’ll delve into several stages of refactoring that will take you through the showcase setup/teardown and PageObject patterns. While this test suite is relatively simple to build, it showcases some of the most prominent features of TestCafe. Finally, this TestCafe book will show you how the tests can be run on a free and simple-to-use website, without requiring you to build and deploy your own servers or backend services. By the end of this book, you’ll have learned how to write and enhance end-to-end tests with TestCafe to solve real-world problems and deliver results. What you will learnUnderstand the basic concepts of TestCafe and how it differs from classic SeleniumFind out how to set up a TestCafe test environmentRun TestCafe with command-line settingsVerify and execute TestCafe code in the browserAutomate end-to-end testing with TestCafe using expert techniquesDiscover best practices in TestCafe development and learn about the future roadmap of TestCafeWho this book is for The book is for QA professionals, test engineers, software engineers, and test automation enthusiasts looking for hands-on guidance on learning about TestCafe. This book is also great for full-stack developers who want to learn more about new tools for testing their code. The book assumes a basic understanding of JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and some simple Bash commands.",

The JavaScript tooling landscape has grown and matured drastically in the past several years. This book will serve as an introduction to both new and well established libraries, frameworks, and utilities that have gained popular traction and support from seasoned developers. It covers tools applicable to the entire development stack, both client- and server-side. While no single book can possibly cover every JavaScript library of value, JavaScript Frameworks for Modern Web Dev focuses on incredibly u seful libraries and frameworks that production software uses. You will be treated to detailed analyses and sample code for tools that manage dependencies, structure code in a modular fashion, automate repetitive build tasks, create specialized servers, structure client side applications, facilitate horizontal scaling, and interacting with disparate data stores. The libraries and frameworks covered include Bower, Grunt, Yeoman, PM2, RequireJS, Browserify, Knockout, AngularJS, Kraken, Mach, Mongoose, Knex, Bookshelf, Faye, Q, Async.js, Underscore, and Lodash. Written from first-hand experience, you will benefit from the glorious victories and innumerable failures of two experienced professionals, gain quick insight into hurdles that aren't always explicitly mentioned in API documentation or Readmes, and quickly learn how to use JavaScript frameworks and libraries like a Pro. Enrich your development skills with JavaScript Frameworks for Modern Web Dev today.",

DESCRIPTION Deno is a web platform that offers capabilities for JavaScript and TypeScript and supports modern web standards. It is a straightforward, up-to-date, secure runtime environment for web developers. This book will teach all you need to know about Deno's primitives, its ideas, and how you can use them to build applications that work in the real world. The book's first part is devoted to familiarizing you with Deno's runtime and comprehensive ecosystem. This book will help you to get familiar with TypeScript and experiment with Deno. The book will also help you to learn about GraphQL and Oak and build basic scripts. It will help you to design basic web applications such as a phonebook application and a to-do list application, both of which will have their user interfaces (UI) and APIs developed. This book will help you to get a good level of confidence with Deno over NodeJS so that you can start using Deno to build, maintain, and deploy web apps that are reliable and secure. WHAT YOU WILL LEARN ● Get started with the basics of TypeScript and Deno. ● Use Deno to create your next React or Svelte app's user interface. ● Develop a GraphQL API server with Deno. ● Make the most of TypeScript when creating applications. ● Take advantage of the various plugins that Deno and its creators offer. WHO THIS BOOK IS FOR Readers interested in utilizing the power of Deno to fuel their apps, whether they are web developers, TypeScript users, or JavaScript users will find this book helpful. The code will be easier to understand if you are familiar with JavaScript already. TABLE OF CONTENTS 1. The Deno Land 2. Introduction to TypeScript 3. Setting Up Deno 4. Deno Ecosystem 5. Todos App - API 6. Todos App - UI Implementation 7. Introduction to GraphQL, Oak, and Oak-GraphQL 8. PhoneBook App—API Implementation 9. PhoneBook App—UI Implementation",
